 <h1>Hunter's Portfolio</h1>
 <p>This is essentially a start to what I'd like to become a professional and creative portfolio.
  Whether it be blogging about things I enjoy for web development practice, or eventually creating cool 
  animations that I'd enjoy, it'll probably end up here. It may take a while but it'll get done!
